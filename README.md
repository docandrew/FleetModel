# FleetModel
Aircraft fleet simulator designed to model maintenance and weather attrition.

This was designed for T-6 aircraft training, and uses historical monthly weather attrition data to simulate a period of sorties.

This program was created to model the T-6 fleet, but with some modifications could be used to simulate any vehicle fleet where vehicles are re-used multiple times per day, with certain probabilities of breaking and/or undergoing regularly scheduled maintenance.
